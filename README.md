# React Native Countdown Timer

A React Native countdown timer component in a circle shape with color and progress animation, **originally made by [Vasil Dimitrov](https://github.com/vydimitrov)**. This fork updates it to the latest version of React Native.

*[His version](https://github.com/vydimitrov/react-countdown-circle-timer/tree/master), while outdated, also supports websites with standard React, if that's what you're looking for*.
